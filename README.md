Restaurant Orders Data Analysis using SQL

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project analyzes a restaurant's order data, providing insights into customer preferences, high-spending orders, and sales trends. The analysis is performed using SQL queries to extract meaningful patterns from the data.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset consists of two primary tables:

menu_items: Contains details of menu items, including name, category, and price.

order_details: Stores order information, including date, time, and items purchased.

Key Questions Answered

What were the least and most ordered items? Which categories do they belong to?

What do high-spending orders look like? Which items were included?


ðŸ”§ SQL Queries Used

ðŸ“Œ Menu Table Analysis
# View the menu table
SELECT * FROM menu_items;

# Find the number of items on the menu
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM menu_items;

# Find the least and most expensive item
SELECT * FROM menu_items ORDER BY price DESC;

# Count number of Italian dishes
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM menu_items WHERE category = 'Italian';

# Average dish price within each category
SELECT category, AVG(price) AS avg_price FROM menu_items GROUP BY category;


ðŸ“Œ Order Details Analysis
# View order details
SELECT * FROM order_details;

# Date range of orders
SELECT MIN(order_date), MAX(order_date) FROM order_details;

# Total number of orders
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) FROM order_details;

# Orders with the most items
SELECT order_id, COUNT(item_id) AS item_count
FROM order_details
GROUP BY order_id
ORDER BY item_count DESC;


ðŸ“Œ Joining Menu & Order Data for Insights
# Combine order details with menu items
SELECT * FROM order_details od
LEFT JOIN menu_items mi ON od.item_id = mi.menu_item_id;

# Most and least ordered items
SELECT item_name, COUNT(order_details_id) AS num_orders
FROM order_details od
LEFT JOIN menu_items mi ON od.item_id = mi.menu_item_id
GROUP BY item_name
ORDER BY num_orders DESC;

# Top 5 highest-spend orders
SELECT order_id, SUM(price) AS total_spend
FROM order_details od
LEFT JOIN menu_items mi ON od.item_id = mi.menu_item_id
GROUP BY order_id
ORDER BY total_spend DESC
LIMIT 5;
